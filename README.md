# RotationalDiffusion

Rotational Diffusion code by Steven Delong, Florencio Balboa, and
Aleksandar Donev (donev@courant.nyu.edu) Courant Institute of
Mathematical Sciences.

This code consists of a quaternion integrator object used to simulate
trajectories of a single rigid body using quaternions, along with
many small related scripts and tests.  

Several example scripts for simulating immersed rigid bodies near a single
wall are present in subfolders.

For usage see doc/USAGE.txt.
