These mostly Python scripts implement the numerical algorithms described in the preprint:

Submitted to J. Chem. Phys., 2015 [http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08868]

This code consists of a quaternion integrator object used to simulate
Brownian trajectories of a single rigid body using quaternions, along with
many small related scripts and tests.  

Several example scripts for simulating immersed rigid bodies near a single
wall are present in subfolders.

For usage see doc/USAGE.txt.
