Rotational and Translational Diffusion of Confined Rigid Bodies

This package contains several python codes to run simulations of 
rigid bodies made out of _blob particles_ rigidly connected near
a single wall (floor). These codes can compute the
mobility of complex shape objects, solve mobility or resistance problems
for suspensions of many bodies or run deterministic or stochastic 
dynamic simulations.

For the theory behind the numerical methods consult the references:

Several example scripts for simulating immersed rigid bodies near a single
wall are present in subfolders.
