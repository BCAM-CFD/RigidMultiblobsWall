# RotationalDiffusion

Rotational Diffusion code by Steven Delong, Florencio Balboa, and
Aleksandar Donev (donev@courant.nyu.edu) Courant Institute of
Mathematical Sciences.

This code consists of a quaternion integrator object used to simulate
trajectories of a single rigid body using quaternions.  Several examples are in subfolders.
