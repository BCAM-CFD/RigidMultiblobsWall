# Magnetic chains
Authors: Tao Yang, Brennan Sprinkle

This example contains the code to reproduce the simulation data shown in 
`Colloidal tubular microrobots for cargo transport and compression`

### Run the code
To run this example, ensure that the makefile has been succesfully run in the `Lubrication` base directory.
Then one may simply type the following into a terminal
```
python main_chain.py --input-file inputfile_suspension.dat
```
and data will be placed in the `./data` directory
