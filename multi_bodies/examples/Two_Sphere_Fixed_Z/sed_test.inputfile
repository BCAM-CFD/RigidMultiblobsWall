# where tu is (6*pi*eta*a^2*deb)/(U_0)

# td = (3*pi*eta*a^3)/(kT) may be smaller
# n_save is n_steps/66
# The rule for computing n_steps is the total time t=15*(a/v) and n_steps = t/dt, where
# v is given by (m*g*cos(theta))/(6*pi*eta*a).  This is the translational componenet of the 
# gravitational potential. However, if the angle is zero, in order to avoid dividing by zero
# you need to consider the vertical component instead.
