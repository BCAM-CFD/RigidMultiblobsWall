# Mapping swimmers to slip-driven swimmers
In this example we provide some utility codes to compute the optimum slip to map any swimmer by slip-driven swimmers.

## 1. Compute squirmer slip
The utility code `squirmer_slip_generation.py` generates the slip on a spherical squirmer given by the formula

```
v_theta = B1 * sin(theta) + 0.5 * B2 * sin(2 * theta),
```

where `theta` is the polar angle on the squirmer surface.


## 2. Compute flow from slip-driven swimmers
We provide the utility code `compute_flow.py` that computes the flow on a shell generated by a slip-driven swimmer.


## 3. Compute optimum slip
The code `compute_slip_from_flow.py` computes the optimum slip to map another swimmer, flagellated or not.
The main inputs of the code are swimming velocity and flow generated on a shell by the original swimmer.

## 4. Compute velocity and flow from flagellated a swimmer
