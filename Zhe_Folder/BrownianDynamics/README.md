### Brownian Dynamics

#### 1. Run the 'brownian_dynamics.m' to get all the results.

#### 2. Error bar figures would be automatically saved in current directory as 't=**.png' and sigma vs t figure would be saved as sigma.png. Prob distribution would be saved in 'prob.mat'. Variance is saved in 'sigma.mat'.

#### 3. Please see 'report/BrownianDynamics.pdf' to see the report that contains theoretic analysis, simulation results and discussions in detail.
